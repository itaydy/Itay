# Itay
I used Windows 10* 64-bit os.
Work Explanation:
* I draw the cones as dots on a XY Graph
* I draw a line in the center between every left and right cone
* The line is the car path.
Problems:
* I wrote a code to read the csv file but it didn't work so i defined the coordinates lists by myself according to the csv file.
* The line I draw is not the best path.
* The best path I could think about is a path that gets close to the cones that are on the side of the bend of the road.
